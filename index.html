  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: June 2, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the mobile application <strong>Driving Thoery</strong> (the "App"), developed for Android devices.</p>

  <h2>Information Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) from users of the App.</p>

  <h2>Advertising and Third-Party SDKs</h2>
  <p>The App displays advertisements using third-party ad networks. These networks may use Software Development Kits (SDKs) that collect non-personal identifiers (such as an advertising ID) in order to serve relevant ads and to limit ad frequency.</p>

  <p>We do not have access to or control over the information that may be collected by these third-party SDKs. The data collected is typically used for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Frequency capping</li>
    <li>Fraud prevention</li>
    <li>Aggregated usage analytics</li>
    <li>Personalized ad targeting (where permitted)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Although we do not store any user data ourselves, we recommend users consult the privacy policies of third-party ad providers integrated in the App.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <strong>geeg.yazilim@gmail.com</strong></p>
